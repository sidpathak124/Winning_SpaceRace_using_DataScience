# Winning_SpaceRace_using_DataScience
An end to end Data Science Project for Space Race

**About the Project**
The project herein, is an end to end Data Science project, i.e it includes elements from data collection 
and web scraping to final deployment of the resultant analysis as an interactive dashboard. It contains the 
following steps :- 

* Data Collection
* Data Wrangling
* EDA with data visualization
* EDA with SQL
* Building an interactive map with Folium (Python library)
* Building an interactive Dashboard with Plotly Dash
* Predictive analytics (Classification)

** Goal **
To predict whether SpaceX Falcon 9's first stage landing will be successful or not. 

** Project Background and Context **
In a rocket launch project, the most cost defining cost factor is the first stage booster (The Most Expensive Part).
If somehow SpaceX can reuse this part they can save a lot of money in the project. This is crucial because SpaceX 
advertises Falcon 9's launch to cost 62 million dollars while other providers charge upwards of 165 million dollars. 

The lower cost that SpaceX can afford is only because it can make its first stage land, saving lots of money. Hence if 
we can predict whether the first stage will land successfully or not, we can determine the cost of the launch. 
This information can then be used while bidding against another company for a rocket launch.
